    "NOTE: the scope if defined during the scoping proccess and will be refined during the project\n",
    "### Step 1: Goals\n",
    "NOTE: Projects should idealy be problem-centric and not data-centric. Starting with data may lead to analysis that is not actionable or relevant to the goals of our organization.\n",
    "#### 1. Problem-centric view: From abstract to optimized\n",
    "    - Abstract: (good) lower the charges / (evil) increase the charges\n",
    "    - Improve: alter the variables that most impact the charges\n",
    "    - Optimezed: get as many people to alter their of BMI and smoking status.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Data-centric view: Project Objectives\n",
    "    - Import a dataset into your program\n",
    "    - Analyze a dataset by building out functions or class methods\n",
    "    - Use libraries to assist in your analysis\n",
    "    - Document and organize your findings\n",
    "    - Make predictions about a dataset’s features based on your findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: What actions/interventions are you informing?\n",
    "NOTE: actions need to be concrete in order to achieve the goal.\n",
    "I will focus only on the good side of the goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible Actions (+ possible action break down):\n",
    "#### 1. Improved BMI -> Data Science key imput -> who should improve and has a benefit by improving their BMI ?\n",
    "    - healthy habbits and eating advice aimed at 75% of the clients\n",
    "    - fitness/sport programs for 40% of the clients\n",
    "    - medical professional care for 10% of the clients\n",
    "#### 2. Smoker to Non-Smoker -> Data Science key imput -> who should and is most likely to quit smoking ?\n",
    "    - health advice to reduce frequency of smoking and expose the risks of smoking for 90% of all the population\n",
    "    - medical advice to 50% of affected population\n",
    "    - advanced support to quit smoking for 10% of the affected population\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: What Data do you have and what Data do you need?\n",
    "#### 1. DATA WE HAVE: The file insurance.csv is where data is organized\n",
    "   **It's good practice to evaluate each data source regarding:**\n",
    "    - how is it stored? -> a well structured CSV file (see details below)\n",
    "    - how was it collected? -> more details www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance\n",
    "    - what is the level of granularity? -> we have data about individuals and actions are aimed at individuals\n",
    "    - how far back does it go? -> unknown, not needed\n",
    "    - how often does new data come in? -> unknown, not needed\n",
    "    - dows it overwrite old fields? -> possible, once the status of an individual changes; does not affect the code\n",
    "    - does it add new rows? -> possible, but current sample size is sufficient; does not affect the code\n",
    "    - is there any collection bias? -> to be determined\n",
    "\n",
    "   **The file has 1339 rows, including the header, and 7 columns:**\n",
    "    - age (integer)\n",
    "    - sex (female / male)\n",
    "    - bmi (float) -> objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9\n",
    "    - children (integer) -> Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents\n",
    "    - smoker (yes / no)\n",
    "    - region (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest) -> the residential area in the US\n",
    "    - charges (float) -> Individual medical costs billed by health insurance -> known from previous projects: estimated_cost = 250 * age − 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * children + 24000 * smoker − 12500 , it might not be true\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Biases that should be evaluated:**\n",
    "    - male to female ratio\n",
    "    - smoker or nonsmoker prevalence\n",
    "    - regional distribution\n",
    "    - age distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible ideas for analysis are the following:\n",
    "- Find out the average age of the patients in the dataset.\n",
    "- Analyze where a majority of the individuals are from.\n",
    "- Look at the different costs between smokers vs. non-smokers.\n",
    "- Figure out what the average age is for someone who has at least one child in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organize your findings into dictionaries, lists, or another convenient datatype.\n",
    "- Make predictions about what features are the most influential for an individual’s medical insurance charges based on your analysis.\n",
    "- Explore areas where the data may include bias and how that would impact potential use cases."
